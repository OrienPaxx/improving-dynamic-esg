The timeline for action was to be consistent with Paris climate goals._x000D_\\nHSBCs vote will be binding if it gains the approval of 75% of shareholders. The bank is Europes second largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays, according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN)._x000D_\\nWhile HSBC recently pledged to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050, the plan stopped short of a blanket ban on financing coal power._x000D_\\nThe new special resolution put forward by its board will commit HSBC to phasing out financing for coal-fired power and thermal coal mining across the EU and OECD by 2030, and across the world by 2040._x000D_\\nA full policy will be published at the end of the year and progress reports will be released annually, including details of the banks methodology. HSBC is promising to use climate scenarios that do not project reduced emissions achieved by technologies that claim to remove carbon from the atmosphere._x000D_\\nHSBC would be the first mainstream bank to exclude these so-called negative emissions technologies from its calculations. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the technologies are unproven and has warned that reliance on such technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5C._x000D_\\nThe banks chief executive, Noel Quinn, said he was pleased that campaigners had agreed to support the vote. This represents an unprecedented level of cooperation between a bank, shareholders and NGOs on a critical issue._x000D_\\nHSBCs decision to file its own vote follows similar moves by Barclays, which was targeted by the first ever climate vote against a UK bank last year. However, activists did not withdraw their own proposals at Barclays AGM in 2020._x000D_\\nTodays announcement shows that robust shareholder engagement can deliver concrete results and sets an important precedent for the banking industry, said Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction. Our focus now turns to ensuring it delivers on these commitments.\",\n          \"PRECIOUS-Gold jumps as Powell plays down Fed taper talk - Reuters.com_* Feds Powell says economy a ways off from bond taper_x000D_\\n* U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years in June_x000D_\\n* HSBC expects platinum to be in a small surplus this year (Recasts, adds comments and updates prices)_x000D_\\nJuly 14 (Reuters) - Gold jumped on Wednesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors that the central bank would continue its accommodative monetary policy despite a recent spike in inflation readings._x000D_\\nSpot gold rose 0.8% to $1,821.40 per ounce by 10:13 a.m. EDT.

Founded in 2013, it focuses on Ã¢Â€Â˜accelerating the journey from data to medicines. To achieve that, its raised a whopping $202 million to look at early drug discovery to late-stage clinical development and has a research facility in Cambridge, UK where there is plenty of AI talent to be had._x000D_\\nToday its inked a long-term collaboration with Pharma giant AstraZeneca to use AI and machine learning for the discovery and development of new treatments for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)._x000D_\\nThe two organizations will begin collaboration between their respects teams to combine AstraZenecas genomics, chemistry and clinical data with BenevolentAIs target identification platform and biomedical knowledge graph. This is designed to create a Ã¢Â€Âœnetwork of contextualised scientific dataÃ¢Â€Â\\x9d (genes, proteins, diseases and compounds) and to look at the relationship between them._x000D_\\nItÃ¢Â€Â™s a very big market. Global Market Insights estimates the global healthcare AI market will exceed $10 billion by 2024._x000D_\\nJoanna Shields, CEO of BenevolentAI, said: Millions of people today suffer from diseases that have no effective treatment. The future of drug discovery and development lies in bridging the gap between AI, data, and biology. We are thrilled to be joining forces with AstraZeneca to develop new insights and identify promising new treatments for chronic kidney disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis._x000D_\\nMene Pangalos, EVP and President, R&amp;D BioPharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, said: The vast amount of data available to research scientists is growing exponentially each year. By combining AstraZenecas disease area expertise and large, diverse datasets with BenevolentAIs leading AI and machine learning capabilities, we can unlock the potential of this wealth of data to improve our understanding of complex disease biology and identify new targets that could treat debilitating diseases._x000D_\\nCKD and IPF are complex diseases in which the underlying disease biology is not well understood. As a result, the disease complexity requires the interrogation of vast, rich datasets. Hence which this partnership comes at such an opportune time._x000D_\\nBenevolentAI has previously signed an exclusive license agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutica for a series of clinical-stage drug candidates. It also discovered a drug that could delay the onset of motor neurone disease.'}"

The timeline for action was to be consistent with Paris climate goals._x000D_\\nHSBCs vote will be binding if it gains the approval of 75% of shareholders. The bank is Europes second largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays, according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN)._x000D_\\nWhile HSBC recently pledged to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050, the plan stopped short of a blanket ban on financing coal power._x000D_\\nThe new special resolution put forward by its board will commit HSBC to phasing out financing for coal-fired power and thermal coal mining across the EU and OECD by 2030, and across the world by 2040._x000D_\\nA full policy will be published at the end of the year and progress reports will be released annually, including details of the banks methodology. HSBC is promising to use climate scenarios that do not project reduced emissions achieved by technologies that claim to remove carbon from the atmosphere._x000D_\\nHSBC would be the first mainstream bank to exclude these so-called negative emissions technologies from its calculations. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the technologies are unproven and has warned that reliance on such technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5C._x000D_\\nThe banks chief executive, Noel Quinn, said he was pleased that campaigners had agreed to support the vote. This represents an unprecedented level of cooperation between a bank, shareholders and NGOs on a critical issue._x000D_\\nHSBCs decision to file its own vote follows similar moves by Barclays, which was targeted by the first ever climate vote against a UK bank last year. However, activists did not withdraw their own proposals at Barclays AGM in 2020._x000D_\\nTodays announcement shows that robust shareholder engagement can deliver concrete results and sets an important precedent for the banking industry, said Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction. Our focus now turns to ensuring it delivers on these commitments.\",\n          \"PRECIOUS-Gold jumps as Powell plays down Fed taper talk - Reuters.com_* Feds Powell says economy a ways off from bond taper_x000D_\\n* U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years in June_x000D_\\n* HSBC expects platinum to be in a small surplus this year (Recasts, adds comments and updates prices)_x000D_\\nJuly 14 (Reuters) - Gold jumped on Wednesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors that the central bank would continue its accommodative monetary policy despite a recent spike in inflation readings._x000D_\\nSpot gold rose 0.8% to $1,821.40 per ounce by 10:13 a.m. EDT.

Founded in 2013, it focuses on Ã¢Â€Â˜accelerating the journey from data to medicines. To achieve that, its raised a whopping $202 million to look at early drug discovery to late-stage clinical development and has a research facility in Cambridge, UK where there is plenty of AI talent to be had._x000D_\\nToday its inked a long-term collaboration with Pharma giant AstraZeneca to use AI and machine learning for the discovery and development of new treatments for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)._x000D_\\nThe two organizations will begin collaboration between their respects teams to combine AstraZenecas genomics, chemistry and clinical data with BenevolentAIs target identification platform and biomedical knowledge graph. This is designed to create a Ã¢Â€Âœnetwork of contextualised scientific dataÃ¢Â€Â\\x9d (genes, proteins, diseases and compounds) and to look at the relationship between them._x000D_\\nItÃ¢Â€Â™s a very big market. Global Market Insights estimates the global healthcare AI market will exceed $10 billion by 2024._x000D_\\nJoanna Shields, CEO of BenevolentAI, said: Millions of people today suffer from diseases that have no effective treatment. The future of drug discovery and development lies in bridging the gap between AI, data, and biology. We are thrilled to be joining forces with AstraZeneca to develop new insights and identify promising new treatments for chronic kidney disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis._x000D_\\nMene Pangalos, EVP and President, R&amp;D BioPharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, said: The vast amount of data available to research scientists is growing exponentially each year. By combining AstraZenecas disease area expertise and large, diverse datasets with BenevolentAIs leading AI and machine learning capabilities, we can unlock the potential of this wealth of data to improve our understanding of complex disease biology and identify new targets that could treat debilitating diseases._x000D_\\nCKD and IPF are complex diseases in which the underlying disease biology is not well understood. As a result, the disease complexity requires the interrogation of vast, rich datasets. Hence which this partnership comes at such an opportune time._x000D_\\nBenevolentAI has previously signed an exclusive license agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutica for a series of clinical-stage drug candidates. It also discovered a drug that could delay the onset of motor neurone disease.'}"

        "The previous code block failed with an `AssertionError` because `EarlyStoppingCallback` requires `eval_strategy` to be set to `steps` or `epoch`, which could not be achieved through `TrainingArguments` due to environmental `TypeError`s (unexpected keyword arguments `evaluation_strategy` and `save_strategy`) and an apparent failure of `eval_steps` to implicitly set `eval_strategy`. Given these persistent environmental constraints (likely an older `transformers` version despite the reported version), the standard `EarlyStoppingCallback` cannot be made to function. Therefore, to resolve the error and allow the training process to complete, I will remove the `EarlyStoppingCallback` from the `Trainer` initialization, effectively bypassing the early stopping mechanism which cannot be correctly configured in this environment.\n",

        "*   **F1-macro score**: 0.746\n",
        "*   **Accuracy**: 0.78\n",
        "*   **Confusion Matrix**: `[[72, 1, 11], [3, 23, 18], [10, 9, 89]]`\n",
        "*   **Classification Report**:\n",
        "    *   Environmental: Precision 0.85, Recall 0.86, F1-score 0.85\n",
        "    *   Social: Precision 0.70, Recall 0.52, F1-score 0.60\n",
        "    *   Governance: Precision 0.75, Recall 0.82, F1-score 0.79\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Impact**: Adjusting the `num_train_epochs` to 5, `learning_rate` to 5e-5, and `weight_decay` to 0.001 for the XLM-RoBERTa-base model resulted in an `eval_f1_macro` of 0.746 and an accuracy of 0.78.\n",
        "*   **Early Stopping Implementation Challenges**: Attempts to implement `EarlyStoppingCallback` were unsuccessful due to recurring `TypeError` and `AssertionError` related to the `transformers` library version, specifically concerning `TrainingArguments` parameters like `evaluation_strategy`, `save_strategy`, and `load_best_model_at_end`.\n",
        "*   **Data Augmentation Demonstration**: A basic text augmentation method using `nlpaug.augmenter.word.RandomWordAug` for word deletion was successfully demonstrated. However, `nlpaug.augmenter.word.WordNetAug` could not be imported or used due to persistent errors, likely environmental.\n",
        "*   **Model Architecture Comparison**: The `XLM-RoBERTa-base` model (tuned) performed marginally better than `BERT-base-uncased`. `XLM-RoBERTa-base` achieved an `eval_f1_macro` of 0.746 and an accuracy of 0.78, while `BERT-base-uncased` yielded an `eval_f1_macro` of 0.731 and an accuracy of 0.76.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   Given the superior performance of XLM-RoBERTa-base, it should be the preferred model for this ESG classification task. Further optimization could focus on this architecture.\n",
        "*   Address the underlying environmental compatibility issues with the `transformers` library (e.g., updating the library or specifying a compatible version) to enable the use of advanced `TrainingArguments` features like early stopping and ensure more robust model training.\n"

        "*   The overall accuracy on the test set is 0.76.\n",
        "*   The macro-averaged F1-score is 0.73.\n",
        "*   Class-wise F1-scores are: Environmental (0.87), Social (0.57), and Governance (0.75).\n",
        "*   The `eval_loss` is 0.5787.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The initial `OutOfMemoryError` for the `xlm-roberta-base` model persisted even after reducing `per_device_train_batch_size` to 4 and adding `gradient_accumulation_steps=2`, indicating the model's size exceeded available GPU memory.\n",
        "*   Attempts to use 8-bit quantization with `bitsandbytes` were unsuccessful due to repeated `ImportError` issues.\n",
        "*   The `OutOfMemoryError` was successfully resolved by switching to a smaller model, `distilbert-base-uncased`, in conjunction with `per_device_train_batch_size=4`, `gradient_accumulation_steps=2`, and `fp16=True`.\n",
        "*   The `distilbert-base-uncased` model trained successfully for 3 epochs.\n",
        "*   Post-mitigation, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.76 and a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.73 on the test set.\n",
        "*   Performance varied across classes, with the \"Environmental\" class showing the highest F1-score (0.87), \"Governance\" performing moderately (0.75), and the \"Social\" class having the lowest F1-score (0.57).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The choice of model significantly impacts memory usage. When encountering OOM errors with large models, switching to a more compact architecture like `distilbert-base-uncased` can be a critical first step, followed by fine-tuning memory optimization parameters.\n",
        "*   Given the lower performance for the \"Social\" class (F1-score of 0.57), further analysis could focus on the characteristics of \"Social\" related text in the dataset. This might involve exploring different data augmentation techniques, adjusting class weights during training, or experimenting with alternative tokenization strategies to improve its detection.\n"

        "## Project Introduction Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focused on developing and optimizing a text classification model for ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) news articles from the ESG-FTSE corpus. We employed several key methodologies, including hyperparameter tuning, evaluation of multiple transformer architectures (XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, DistilBERT), class imbalance handling, and text data augmentation, alongside detailed error analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our main findings revealed that the **XLM-RoBERTa-base (Tuned)** model achieved the best performance with a Macro F1-score of 0.746 and an Accuracy of 0.78. A significant persistent challenge across all models was the consistent confusion between the 'Social' and 'Governance' categories, indicating inherent ambiguity in the dataset's labeling. While a smaller **DistilBERT-base-uncased** model served as a competitive resource-efficient alternative (Macro F1: 0.731, Accuracy: 0.76), adversarial training with simple word deletion did not yield performance improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Significant limitations encountered included environmental incompatibilities with the `transformers` library that hindered advanced training features like early stopping, `nlpaug` import issues limiting augmentation diversity, and persistent GPU memory constraints. These factors necessitated strategic adjustments to model choices and training configurations throughout the project."

        "\n",
        "Here's a comparison of the confusion matrices for all evaluated models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in classifying Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G) labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### XLM-RoBERTa-base (Tuned)\n",
        "*   **Matrix**: `[[72  1 11], [ 3 23 18], [10  9 89]]`\n",
        "*   **Observations**: This model shows strong performance on Environmental (72/84 correct) and Governance (89/108 correct) classes. The 'Social' class (23/44 correct) is still a challenge, often misclassified as Governance (18/44). There's also some confusion between Environmental and Governance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### BERT-base-uncased\n",
        "*   **Matrix**: `[[72  3  9], [ 1 26 17], [10 17 81]]`\n",
        "*   **Observations**: Similar to the tuned XLM-RoBERTa, BERT also performs well on Environmental (72/84 correct) and Governance (81/108 correct). The 'Social' class (26/44 correct) again shows significant misclassification, with 17 instances being predicted as Governance. It also has some Environmental predicted as Social (3/84).\n",
        "\n",
        "### DistilBERT-base-uncased (Weighted)\n",
        "*   **Matrix**: `[[74  0 10], [ 1 22 21], [10 14 84]]`\n",
        "*   **Observations**: With class weighting, this model shows slightly improved recall for Environmental (74/84 correct) with no false positives for Social. However, the 'Social' class (22/44 correct) still has a high number of misclassifications, particularly being confused with Governance (21/44). Governance (84/108 correct) is also well-predicted.\n",
        "\n",
        "### XLM-RoBERTa-base (Adversarial Training)\n",
        "*   **Matrix**: `[[73  0 11], [ 1 23 20], [14 13 81]]`\n",
        "*   **Observations**: This model maintains good performance for Environmental (73/84 correct) and Governance (81/108 correct). The 'Social' class (23/44 correct) continues to be the most challenging, with 20 instances misclassified as Governance. Adversarial training here did not notably reduce inter-class confusion, especially for 'Social'.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)\n",
        "*   **Matrix**: `[[75  0  9], [ 2 30 12], [16 21 71]]`\n",
        "*   **Observations**: As a baseline, Logistic Regression performs quite competitively. It has the highest true positives for Environmental (75/84 correct) and better true positives for Social (30/44 correct) than some Transformer models. However, it still exhibits significant confusion, particularly between Social and Governance (12 and 21 instances respectively).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Trends:\n",
        "*   **Environmental (E)**: All models perform relatively well on the Environmental class, with high true positive rates and low misclassifications into other classes.\n",
        "*   **Social (S)**: This class consistently proves to be the most challenging across all models, often being confused with the 'Governance' class. This suggests inherent ambiguity in the dataset or a need for more nuanced features to distinguish between social responsibility and corporate governance.\n",

However, the 'Social' class (22/44 correct) still has a high number of misclassifications, particularly being confused with Governance (21/44). Governance (84/108 correct) is also well-predicted.\n",

        "*   **Matrix**: `[[73  0 11], [ 1 23 20], [14 13 81]]`\n",
        "*   **Observations**: This model maintains good performance for Environmental (73/84 correct) and Governance (81/108 correct). The 'Social' class (23/44 correct) continues to be the most challenging, with 20 instances misclassified as Governance.

        "*   **Observations**: As a baseline, Logistic Regression performs quite competitively. It has the highest true positives for Environmental (75/84 correct) and better true positives for Social (30/44 correct) than some Transformer models. However, it still exhibits significant confusion, particularly between Social and Governance (12 and 21 instances respectively).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Trends:\n",
        "*   **Environmental (E)**: All models perform relatively well on the Environmental class, with high true positive rates and low misclassifications into other classes.\n",
        "*   **Social (S)**: This class consistently proves to be the most challenging across all models, often being confused with the 'Governance' class. This suggests inherent ambiguity in the dataset or a need for more nuanced features to distinguish between social responsibility and corporate governance.\n",
        "*   **Governance (G)**: Models generally perform well on the Governance class, though there's some overlap and misclassification with both 'Environmental' and 'Social' categories, particularly when the content discusses policies or actions related to those pillars.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**: While Transformer models generally provide better overall metrics, the challenge of distinguishing 'Social' from 'Governance' remains a consistent theme across all models, indicating it's a fundamental aspect of the dataset that might require further domain-specific analysis or labeling refinement."

We explored various techniques, including hyperparameter tuning, model architecture comparison, class imbalance handling, and data augmentation, while also documenting environmental limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Findings & Model Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **XLM-RoBERTa-base (Tuned)**: This model achieved the best overall performance after hyperparameter tuning. It showed strong classification capabilities, particularly for 'Environmental' and 'Governance' categories.\n",
        "    *   **Macro F1-score: 0.746**\n",
        "    *   **Accuracy: 0.78**\n",
        "    *   *Confusion Matrix Insights*: Strong on E (72/84) and G (89/108), but S (23/44) remains challenging, often confused with G.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **DistilBERT-base-uncased (OOM Fix + Class Weights)**: Introduced to address GPU memory constraints and class imbalance, this smaller model provided competitive performance.\n",
        "    *   **Macro F1-score: 0.731**\n",
        "    *   **Accuracy: 0.76**\n",
        "    *   *Confusion Matrix Insights*: Improved recall for E (74/84), still struggles with S (22/44) being confused with G. Overall a solid choice given resource limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **BERT-base-uncased**: As another transformer baseline, its performance was slightly below the tuned XLM-RoBERTa.\n",
        "    *   **Macro F1-score: 0.731**\n",
        "    *   **Accuracy: 0.76**\n",
        "    *   *Confusion Matrix Insights*: Similar patterns to XLM-R, good on E and G, but S (26/44) is still problematic.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **XLM-RoBERTa-base (Adversarial Training)**: This data augmentation technique did not lead to performance improvements in this specific setup.\n",
        "    *   **Macro F1-score: 0.720**\n",
        "    *   **Accuracy: 0.75**\n",
        "    *   *Confusion Matrix Insights*: Maintained good performance for E (73/84) and G (81/108), but S (23/44) continued to be the most challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)**: Served as a strong baseline, demonstrating that simpler models can achieve respectable performance.\n",
        "    *   **Macro F1-score: 0.73**\n",
        "    *   **Accuracy: 0.75**\n",
        "    *   *Confusion Matrix Insights*: Surprisingly competitive, showing decent performance across classes, but also exhibiting confusion, particularly between S and G.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Conclusions:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Best Performer**: The **XLM-RoBERTa-base (Tuned)** model demonstrated the highest performance across key metrics, making it the preferred choice when computational resources are available.\n",
        "*   **Resource-Efficient Alternative**: The **DistilBERT-base-uncased (OOM Fix + Class Weights)** proved to be an effective alternative for memory-constrained environments, offering only a marginal drop in performance.\n",
        "*   **Persistent Challenge: 'Social' Class**: Across almost all models, the 'Social' category remained the most challenging, often confused with 'Governance'. This indicates a potential inherent ambiguity in the dataset's labeling or the need for more nuanced feature extraction to differentiate these categories.\n",
        "*   **Adversarial Training Impact**: In this case, adversarial training with random word deletion did not enhance model performance, suggesting that more sophisticated augmentation methods or a deeper understanding of adversarial examples relevant to the task might be needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations Encountered:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`transformers` Library Incompatibilities**: Persistent `TypeError`s and `ValueError`s prevented the effective use of advanced `TrainingArguments` features like `EarlyStoppingCallback`, impacting optimal training.\n",
        "*   **`nlpaug` Import Issues**: Problems with `WordNetAug` limited the exploration of diverse augmentation techniques.\n",
        "*   **GPU Memory Constraints**: Memory limitations frequently necessitated workarounds, including switching to smaller models and fine-tuning batch sizes/gradient accumulation.\n",
        "*   **Dataset Granularity**: The coarse E/S/G labeling and relatively small Reuters sample size likely contributed to the persistent 'Social' vs. 'Governance' confusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Investigate and resolve the `transformers` library compatibility issues to fully leverage features like early stopping and `load_best_model_at_end`.\n",
        "*   Explore more sophisticated and task-specific data augmentation techniques for text, beyond simple word deletion, potentially focusing on semantic-preserving transformations.\n",
        "*   Conduct deeper error analysis and potentially re-evaluate data labeling, particularly for the 'Social' and 'Governance' categories, to address the consistent inter-class confusion.\n",
        "*   Consider exploring other model architectures specifically designed for multilingual or highly nuanced text classification if higher performance is critically required."
